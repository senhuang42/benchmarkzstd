The Project Gutenberg Etext of The 1913 Webster Unabridged Dictionary
******This file should be named pgw050ab.txt or pgw050ab.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, pgw051ab.txt

This etext was prepared by MICRA, INc. of Plainfield, NJ.  See below
for contact information.  Portions of the text have been proof-read 
and supplemented by volunteers, who have helped greatly to
improve the accuracy of this electronic version.

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do usually do NOT! keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution

<p><point26>A.</point26></p>

<p><hw>A</hw> (<i>named &amacr; in the English, and most commonly &auml; in
other languages</i>). <def>The first letter of the English and of many
other alphabets. The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western
Europe, as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic, black
letter, etc., are all descended from the old Latin A, which was borrowed
from the Greek <i>Alpha</i>, of the same form; and this was made from the
first letter (&?;) of the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet, the equivalent of the
Hebrew <i>Aleph</i>, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The <i>Aleph</i>
was a consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an
element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent their
vowel <i>Alpha</i> with the &auml; sound, the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet
having no vowel symbols.</def></p>

<p>This letter, in English, is used for several different vowel sounds. See
<i>Guide to pronunciation</i>, &sect;&sect; 43-74. The regular long
<i>a</i>, as in <i>fate</i>, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has
taken the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was
a sound of the quality of &auml; (as in <i>far</i>).</p>

<p><sn><b>2.</b></sn> <i>(Mus.)</i> <def>The name of the sixth tone in the
model major scale (that in C), or the first tone of the minor scale, which
is named after it the scale in A minor. The second string of the violin is
tuned to the A in the treble staff. -- A sharp (A&sharp;) is the name of a
musical tone intermediate between A and B. -- A flat (A&flat;) is the name
of a tone intermediate between A and G.</def></p>

form of <i>an</i>. AS. &amacr;n one. See <u>One</u>.] <def>An adjective,
commonly called the indefinite article, and signifying <i>one</i> or
<i>any</i>, but less emphatically.</def> "At <i>a</i> birth"; "In <i>a</i>
word"; "At <i>a</i> blow". <i>Shak.</i> It is placed before nouns of the
singular number denoting an individual object, or a quality individualized,
before collective nouns, and also before plural nouns when the adjective
<i>few</i> or the phrase <i>great many</i> or <i>good many</i> is
interposed; as, <i>a</i> dog, <i>a</i> house, <i>a</i> man; <i>a</i> color;
<i>a</i> sweetness; <i>a</i> hundred, <i>a</i> fleet, <i>a</i> regiment;
<i>a</i> few persons, <i>a</i> great many days.  It is used for <i>an</i>,
for the sake of euphony, before words beginning with a consonant sound [for
exception of certain words beginning with <i>h</i>, see <u>An</u>]; as, a
table, <i>a woman</i>, <i>a</i> year, <i>a</i> unit, <i>a</i> eulogy,
<i>a</i> ewe, <i>a</i> oneness, such <i>a</i> one, etc.  Formally <i>an</i>
was used both before vowels and consonants.</p>

etc.</def></p>

<p><sn><b>2.</b></sn> <def>In process of; in the act of; into; to; -- used
with verbal substantives in <i>-ing</i> which begin with a consonant. This
is a shortened form of the preposition <i>an</i> (which was used before the
vowel sound); as in <i>a</i> hunting, <i>a</i> building, <i>a</i>
begging.</def> "Jacob, when he was <i>a</i> dying" <i>Heb. xi. 21.</i>
"We'll <i>a</i> birding together." " It was <i>a</i> doing." <i>Shak.</i>
"He burst out <i>a</i> laughing." <i>Macaulay.</i>  The hyphen may be used
to connect <i>a</i> with the verbal substantive (as, <i>a</i>-hunting,
<i>a</i>-building) or the words may be written separately. This form of
expression is now for the most part obsolete, the <i>a</i> being omitted
and the verbal substantive treated as a participle.</p>

<p><hw>A-</hw>. <def>A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from
various sources. (1) It frequently signifies <i>on</i> or <i>in</i> (from
<i>an</i>, <i>a</i> forms of AS. <i>on</i>), denoting a state, as in
<i>a</i>foot, on foot, <i>a</i>bed, <i>a</i>miss, <i>a</i>sleep, aground,
<i>a</i>loft, <i>a</i>way (AS. <i>onweg</i>), and analogically,
<i>a</i>blaze, <i>a</i>tremble, etc. (2) AS. <i>of</i> off, from, as in
<i>a</i>down (AS. <i>ofd&umacr;ne</i> off the <i>dun</i> or hill). (3) AS.

intensive force, and sometimes the sense of <i>away</i>, <i>on</i>,
<i>back</i>, as in <i>a</i>rise, <i>a</i>bide, <i>a</i>go. (4) Old English
<i>y-</i> or <i>i-</i> (corrupted from the AS. inseparable particle <i>ge-
</i>, cognate with OHG. <i>ga-</i>, <i>gi-</i>, Goth. <i>ga-</i>), which,
as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in aware. (5)
French <i>&agrave;</i> (L. <i>ad</i> to), as in <i>a</i>base,
<i>a</i>chieve. (6) L. <i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>abs</i>, from, as in
<i>a</i>vert. (7) Greek insep. prefix &alpha; without, or privative, not,
as in <i>a</i>byss, <i>a</i>theist; akin to E. <i>un-</i>.</def></p>

<p>Besides these, there are other sources from which the prefix <i>a</i>
takes its origin.</p>

<p><hw>A 1</hw> (&amacr; w&ubreve;n). <def>A registry mark given by
underwriters (as at Lloyd's) to ships in first-class condition. Inferior

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign;
abdicate; quit; relinquish; renounce; desert; forsake; leave; retire;
withdraw from. -- <u>To Abandon</u>, <u>Desert</u>, <u>Forsake</u>. These
words agree in representing a person as <i>giving up</i> or <i>leaving</i>
some object, but differ as to the mode of doing it. The distinctive sense
of abandon is that of giving up a thing absolutely and finally; as, to
abandon one's friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless
enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. <i>Abandon</i> is more widely applicable
than <i>forsake</i> or <i>desert</i>. The Latin original of <i>desert</i>
appears to have been originally applied to the case of deserters from
military service. Hence, the verb, when used of <i>persons</i> in the
active voice, has usually or always a bad sense, implying some breach of
fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person should
rightfully stand by and support; as, to <i>desert</i> one's colors, to
<i>desert</i> one's post, to <i>desert</i> one's principles or duty. When
used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were
<i>deserted</i>, a <i>deserted</i> village, <i>deserted</i> halls.
<i>Forsake</i> implies the breaking off of previous habit, association,
personal connection, or that the thing left had been familiar or
frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to <i>forsake</i> the paths of
rectitude, the blood <i>forsook</i> his cheeks. It may be used either in a
good or in a bad sense.</p>

open and shameless immoralities, either in private life or political

conscience and hardening of heart produced by a man's giving himself wholly

describes the condition of one who has become insensible to reproof, and

<i>Debase</i> has reference to the bringing down of a thing in purity, or

indulgence, to <i>debase</i> one's style by coarse or vulgar expressions.
<i>Degrade</i> has reference to a bringing down from some higher

the clerical office. When used in a moral sense, it denotes a bringing down
in character and just estimation; as, <i>degraded</i> by intemperance, a

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame.  -- To
<u>Abash</u>, Confuse, <u>Confound</u>. <i>Abash</i> is a stronger word
than <i>confuse</i>, but not so strong as <i>confound</i>. We are
<i>abashed</i> when struck either with sudden shame or with a humbling
sense of inferiority; as, Peter was <i>abashed</i> by the look of his
Master.  So a modest youth is <i>abashed</i> in the presence of those who
are greatly his superiors. We are <i>confused</i> when, from some
unexpected or startling occurrence, we lose clearness of thought and self-
possession. Thus, a witness is often <i>confused</i> by a severe cross-
examination; a timid person is apt to be <i>confused</i> in entering a room
full of strangers. We are <i>confounded</i> when our minds are overwhelmed,
as it were, by something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so
that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually <i>confounded</i>
at the discovery of his guilt.</p>

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish;
lessen.  -- To <u>Abate</u>, <u>Subside</u>. These words, as here compared,
imply a coming down from some previously raised or excited state.
<i>Abate</i> expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a diminution
of force or of intensity; as, the storm <i>abates</i>, the cold
<i>abates</i>, the force of the wind <i>abates</i>; or, the wind
<i>abates</i>, a fever <i>abates</i>. <i>Subside</i> (to settle down) has
reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion; as, the waves
<i>subside</i> after a storm, the wind <i>subsides</i> into a calm. When
the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed.
If we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or
strength, the word to be used is <i>abate</i>. Thus we say, a man's anger
<i>abates</i>, the ardor of one's love <i>abates</i>, "Winter's rage
<i>abates</i>". But if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from
preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is <i>subside</i>;
as, the tumult of the people <i>subsides</i>, the public mind
<i>subsided</i> into a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which
are tumultuous in their nature; as, his passion <i>subsides</i>, his joy
quickly <i>subsided</i>, his grief <i>subsided</i> into a pleasing
melancholy. Yet if, in such cases, we were thinking of the degree of
violence of the emotion, we might use <i>abate</i>; as, his joy will
<i>abate</i> in the progress of time; and so in other instances.</p>
